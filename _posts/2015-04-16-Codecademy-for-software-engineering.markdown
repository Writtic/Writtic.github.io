### HTML & CSS
1. The Javascript is executed on the user's processor instead of the web server therefore saving bandwidth and pressure on the web server.
2. The Javascript is relatively easy to study and comprises of syntax that is close to English.
3. Third party add-ons like Greasemonkey from FireFox make Javascript developers write snippets of Javascript which can execute on desired web pages to extend its functionality.
4. Tasks in javascript on web pages are usually simple so as to prevent being a memory hog.

### PHP
1. Runs on practically any platform - not only on Linux, but also, for example, on Windows, Unix, and IBM's System.
2. We can implement changes even after starting development, without losing valuable time due to 'Flexibility'.
3. Thanks to the popularity of the PHP, the number of free resources online and offline is continuously growing.
4. By choosing PHP, your recruitment process might turn out to be that extra bit easier.
