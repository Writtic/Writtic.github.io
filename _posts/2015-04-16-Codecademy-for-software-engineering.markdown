<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is what I've done for the report of software engineering. 
I learned HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP and Ruby.

### HTML & CSS

### Java Script

1. The Javascript is implemented on the user's processor instead of the web server therefore saving bandwidth and pressure on the web server.
2. The Javascript is relatively easy to study and comprises of syntax that is close to English and that is similar to C and Java programming languages.
3. Third party add-ons like Greasemonkey from FireFox make Javascript developers write snippets of Javascript which can execute on desired web pages to extend its functionality.
4. Tasks in javascript on web pages are usually simple so as to prevent being a memory hog.
5. Regardless of Operating System the Javascript works very well.

### PHP

1. PHP can be easily embedded directly into HTML due to the syntax <?php ?>.
2. PHP Runs on practically any platform - not only on Linux, but also, for example, on Windows, Unix, and IBM's System.
3. We can carry out changes even after starting development, without losing valuable time due to 'Flexibility'.
4. Thanks to the popularity of the PHP, the number of free resources online and offline is continuously growing because of open source.
5. There are many hosting companies that will, for a few dollars a month, give you a server running PHP so you can make a website really easily.

### Ruby
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/drJgqY5.png" alt=""></p>
1. Ruby is Object-oriented, meaning it allows users to manipulate data structures called objects in order to build and execute programs.
2. Ruby is not too unique, so a programmer with basic knowledge of programming languages can learn it very quickly.
3. Blocks, the syntax of Ruby, allow arbitrary, multi-line closures to be cleanly passed in-line anywhere. But syntactically Lambdas in Python can only easy express a single expression, not multiple nested statements.
4. Interpreted, meaning you don't need a compiler to write and run Ruby.
5. Mix-ins allow imported classes and modules to be extended and overridden by user code.

### Python
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dVzq5kn.png" alt=""></p>
1. The syntax of the Python is readable and clear. The way organized, it imposes some order(indentation, without braces and semicolons) to programmers.
2. The Python supports writing much larger programs and better code reuse through a true object-oriented programming style, where classes and inheritance play an important role than JavaScript.
3. The Python not just works on multiple systems, but it even has a similar interface on different platforms.
4. The Python is quite simple to learn as its code resembles the pseudo code.
5. The community of Python offers great amount of support to the Python users always.
