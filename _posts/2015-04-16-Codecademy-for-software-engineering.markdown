#### Java Script
1. The Javascript is executed on the user's processor instead of the web server therefore saving bandwidth and pressure on the web server.
2. The Javascript is relatively easy to study and comprises of syntax that is close to English.
3. Third party add-ons like Greasemonkey from FireFox make Javascript developers write snippets of Javascript which can execute on desired web pages to extend its functionality.
4. Tasks in javascript on web pages are usually simple so as to prevent being a memory hog.
5. Regardless of OS It works very well
